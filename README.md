## User Story

### 
As a user, I will be able to search for the weather of a specific city by inputting a city within the "Search for a City" box. Once th user clicks the "search" button, the page will yield results of the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index of that city. The user will also be able to view a 5-day weather forecast for their searched city which will contain the temperature and humidity. Along with the numeric data pertaining to the city, weather icons will also display which depict what kind of weather will be happening i.e. (cloudy, rainy, snow, or sunny).

Once the user has searched for a city's weather, that city will be stored beneath the "search" button and will continue to do so for each past city the user has searched.
